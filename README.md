# Policy Management Portfolio Project

This is my first portfolio project as a Data Analyst.  
The goal is to practice the full analytics workflow using a synthetic dataset:

1. **Excel** â€“ clean and prepare data  
2. **Power BI** â€“ build dashboards and visuals  
3. **SQL (SQLite/DBLite)** â€“ load clean data and run analysis queries  

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository as I learn and make progress.
