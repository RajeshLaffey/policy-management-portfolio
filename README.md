# ðŸ“Š Policy Management Portfolio Project

This is my first portfolio project as a Data Analyst.  
The goal is to practice the full analytics workflow using a synthetic dataset:

1. **Excel** â€“ clean and prepare data  
2. **Power BI** â€“ build dashboards and visuals  
3. **SQL (SQLite/DBLite)** â€“ load clean data and run analysis queries
4. **Product Owner** - define vision, create personas, build backlog, acceptance criteria

Iâ€™ll be updating this repository as I learn and make progress.

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
The dataset is synthetic but modeled after a real organizational environment with:  
- **Policies** (~300)  
- **Reviews** (~3,000 over 5 years)  
- **Departments** (15 across divisions)  
- **Employees** (10 in Compliance, plus division chiefs and supervisors)  

The project demonstrates the steps a Data Analyst takes to move from messy, raw data â†’ clean datasets â†’ dashboards â†’ SQL insights.
