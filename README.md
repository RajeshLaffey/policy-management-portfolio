# Policy Management Portfolio Project

This is my first portfolio project as a Data Analyst.  
The goal is to practice the full analytics workflow using a synthetic dataset:

1. **Excel** – clean and prepare data  
2. **Power BI** – build dashboards and visuals  
3. **SQL (SQLite/DBLite)** – load clean data and run analysis queries  

I’ll be updating this repository as I learn and make progress.
